# Android-app
There are some android apps in this repo.
## Part 1 Blocks
I develop 9 basic building blocks in this part.
## Part 2 Combination
My own app is called Shopping Fast-Pass. I combined some blocks to transform your idea of application into executable code.
### This application aims to provide convenience for customers to place the products they want to buy. In the app, products are provided 
with their shopping links for customers to find the shopping website fastly.

### What blocks I achieved:
1. button which triggers an action when clicked
2. display a pop-up message ("toast")
3. display a list of items to choose from: In the second activity, I will use listView for different brands.
4. display a web page: after choosing the brand and click OK, go to show web page.
5. use at least 2 layouts (vertical or horizontal LinearLayout, or RelativeLayout)
6. composed of at least 2 linked activities
